Hello! I am Philip. I live and work in Seattle, with my wife Sue and my cat Ruby.

My skill in this life is software and technology.  My interests are good design,
elegant programming languages, and properly applied statistics.

I also [photograph](http://sueandphilip.smugmug.com), scuba dive, and (soon) drive a Seattle trolleybus.
