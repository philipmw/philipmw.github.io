Hello, friend! This is my new blog, replacing my [Blogspot blog](http://philip4g.blogspot.com/).

This one is nicer for me because it's revision-controlled and totally static.

More importantly, am I going to resume writing good content?
Only time will tell.
I *am* motivated to blog because some interesting things are going on in my life.

Add me to your blog aggregator (using the Atom feed), dear reader, and partake in my life.
