I've always had an interest in formal methods in software.

In 2013 I took a grad course, _Formal Methods in Software Engineering_, from U-Iowa's Cesare Tinelli.
One of the tools the course taught is [MIT Alloy](http://alloy.mit.edu/alloy/), a constraint-solver and model-finder.

What I immediately liked about Alloy is its (relative) accessibility: it's a standalone, cross-platform GUI program.
There's not even an installation process: double-click it, and voila.
This is in line with Alloy's general philosophy of encouraging quick experimentation on small models.
